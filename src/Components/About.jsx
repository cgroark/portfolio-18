                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I'm a full-stack web developer with experience building websites and untangling problems and developing efficient systems and tools in the private and non-profit sectors.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>Working with diverse teams of developers and UX designers, Iâ€™ve applied my experience with front-end and back-end technologies to build responsive websites that provide a seamless interaction for users. Prior to engineering, I worked for consulting firms and non-profits where I garnered experience managing programs, teams, budgets and business development processes. When I'm not writing code, you'll find me on my bike or in the Cascades.</p>
